I did my high schooling from Sardar Patel Vidyalaya. The school focused on overall development of a child rather than just concentrating on studying. My venture with visual design started when I was assigned to make a trailer/introductory video for the annual sportz quiz in our school. Following post details some of my best work in this field.

## Imbroglio: Sportz Quiz
If you have come across a SPV alumuni, ask him/her about the sports quiz. The annual quiz is a much awaited tradition of our school. I led a team of 4 students to conceptualize, animate, edit and post process the trailer for the sports quiz of 2012. This video was my last project as a visual design artist.

## The Jump
I experimented with visual effects for the first time while conceptualizing the following video. Setup and work included a green screen, post processing, color correction and background score.

## General Body Meeting
Our school had an executive student council to organize events and look after student welfare. Following video documents the work of the 2012-2013 council.

## Conserve Water
This was my first venture with visual design. As an environmental science project, I didn't want to present boring power point presentations. Hence I chose a more visual narrative.
