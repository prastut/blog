This post documents my experience of working with [Professor Venkatesh Rajamanickam](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/venkat/index.html) as a research intern. Professor Venkatesh heads the [Info Design Lab](https://info-design-lab.github.io/) as well as the [Interaction Design Program](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/academics/interaction-design.html) at [Industrial Design Center (IDC)](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/), IIT Bombay. He is amongst the leading experts in the field of data visualization in India. 

Bubble is a startup idea by Shivam Kumar & Harsha Gangisetty, students at IIT Bombay, and they are mentored by Professor Venkatesh. According to the skillsets of the interns, he asked if I wished to collobarate with them. I was more than happy to accept! The idea of hacking onto a product has always excited me.

## About Bubble Social
A large volume of data is generated by people on Social Media platforms each day. This data is made up of comments and opinions about what’s happening around the world. Be it a political event or a natural disaster, a sports event happening halfway across the globe or a new product release. Owing to its massive volume, the data is not consumable for people who want to use social media to follow one or more of the above mentioned topics.

Social Media platforms have tackled this problem by establishing content recommendation engines which provide people most relevant comments and opinions. This leaves the important aspect of overall crowd opinion out of the scope of the platforms. Its impact can be seen in the form of current social media consumption trends where users get stuck in niches based on their usage trends. This is the single biggest challenge to the evolution of Social Media as Participatory Media Platforms.

Bubble integrates social interactions with content consumption experience to provide you a single stream for all your news/debates/discussions alike. The proposed framework distilles large volumes of social media data about any given topic to mine crowd opinion and present it in a consumable format for the people.

## Primary Research
We initially focused on sports events...
We started with observing the global trends on how sports fans engage in a match-watching activity and analyzed their needs and the cause of their behaviour. The same is tabulated below.

## Understanding the User
 
We conducted several contextual inquiries inside and outside the IIT Bombay campus to understand the user domain. It took us a week to create affinity maps and come up with insights about our user. We tried to analyse user needs, user behaviour, their response and affinity towards sport news and then categorised them into different user groups.


## Result of Research
We classified the users into 5 groups:
 
* **Basic 1** : Do not care about the sport news, does not proactively spend time to research the sport news, but will consume news only when it is spoon-fed to them in a digestible format.
* **Basic 2** : Want basic sport news, but are not ready to devote their time to watch the matches.
* **Intermediate 1** : Actively seek basic sport info and watch the matches.
* **Intermediate 2** : Actively seek intermediate sport info and share/seek opinions of other sport fans.
* **Advanced** : Actively seek all the info and participate in deep opinionated sport discussions.
 
Out of the above categories, we decided that we would not be able to help the Basic 1 category because they simple do not care about sports. Also we would not be able to help the Advanced category because they already know it all and will continue to do so even without any help.
 
So we decided that our target users would be the three categories of Basic 2, Intermediate 1, and Intermediate 2.

## Framework

We extract Social Media posts relevant to a topic using ‘Listeners’. A ‘Listener’ is a set of keywords corresponding to a topic,updated and maintained manually. 


![framework](/images/dataviz/framework.jpg)

Each post is then processed using using our Sentiments Analysis engine which provides 3 things:
* Sentiment value carried by the post (positive or negative)
* Entities mentioned in the post
* Timestamp

Using the processed data we compute an ‘Opinion Index’ which represents the overall crowd opinion towards the topic at that particular instant. Coupled with time, this index enables us to capture the evolution of crowd sentiments over time. Further, posts can be filtered based on the entities they have mentioned, which gives individual trends for each entity associated with the topic.

Next, we propose a framework to represent this information in a consumable format for the people. 

### Consumable Framework

‘Opinion Index’ consists of two values, Positive Sentiment Index and Negative Sentiment Index, along with a timestamp. We opted against computing a single index to preserve the polarity of the crowd opinion at any given instant. 


The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents magnitude of the ‘Opinion Index’. The Positive and Negative Opinion Index is represented by ‘Green’ and ‘Red’ lines respectively.

We intend to provide two bits of information through this visualisation:
Polarity of crowd opinion which is communicated by the relative position of Positive and Negative lines corresponding to any given point on the horizontal axis
Evolution of crowd opinion over time which is communicated by the trends formed by the line charts over time

The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents magnitude of the ‘Opinion Index’. The Positive and Negative Opinion Index is represented by ‘Green’ and ‘Red’ lines respectively.

We intend to provide two bits of information through this visualisation:
Polarity of crowd opinion which is communicated by the relative position of Positive and Negative lines corresponding to any given point on the horizontal axis
Evolution of crowd opinion over time which is communicated by the trends formed by the line charts over time

(adding context)

It was observed that people were unable to get the context of the crowd opinion while consuming the visualisation. To counter this, factual description of the events were added by replacing the horizontal axis with an events timeline.

The crowd opinion plotted over an events timeline gives a context for consuming crowd reactions. 

We then decided to project the continuous index values to an axis of discrete values represented by emoticons. Emoticons make the sentiment information represented by the line chart more comprehensible.

A user can explore the events on the events timeline and get the crowd reactions using the line chart. Hovering over the line chart reveals emoticons and shows the polarity of the opinion as percentage split between positive and negative opinions. 

(adding ‘Bubbles’)

While Opinion Index provides information about how the crowd is reacting towards a topic on the whole, qualitative information such as observations and analysis are hidden in individual social media posts.

To integrate this feature into the proposed framework, we built a layer of Bubble chart over line chart, keeping the axes constant.

Each post is represented by a bubble. The vertical position of the bubble corresponds to the magnitude of sentiment the post carries, represented by emoticons. The horizontal position is simply the time at which it was posted. We classify bubbles as positive or negative using green or red colored outline respectively. The size of the bubble represents the popularity of the post.

Bubble chart faced an overcrowding problem owing to the high volume of the data. To filter the data, instead of opting for a recommendation engine, we rather use an algorithm which predicts the popularity of the post in general.

## Conclusion

The proposed framework provides information about the overall crowd reaction about a given topic. Using event timeline, a temporal aspect is added which aids the overall understanding by adding a chronological sense to the series of events. Popular posts about the topic are also integrated into the framework. 

People can use this framework as a participatory media platform for following an event or a news.
